# Arduino_7Segment-display
# Arduino 7-Segment Display Counter

## Overview
This is an Arduino-based project that uses a 7-segment display to count from 0 to 9. The display is driven by an Arduino Uno and uses simple logic to turn on the correct segments for each number.

## Components Needed:
- Arduino Uno (or any compatible board)
- 7-Segment Display (Common Cathode)
- Resistors (220Î© for each segment)
- Jumper wires

## Circuit:
- Pin connections for segments A-G and Common Cathode.

## Code:
- The code drives the 7-segment display to show numbers 0-9, one digit per second.

## How to Run:
- Connect the display to the Arduino as per the circuit diagram.
- Upload the code to the Arduino using Arduino IDE.
- Watch the display count from 0 to 9 every second!
